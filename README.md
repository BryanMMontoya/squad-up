# SquadUP ðŸŽ®

SquadUP is a social platform designed for gamers to easily find and join squads based on the video game they are playing, the number of players needed, and their in-game rank. Think of it as a "pick-up game" environment for online gamingâ€”helping you connect with the right teammates, whenever you want to play.

## What does SquadUP do?

- **Find Squads:** Search for open squads by game title, number of players needed, and rank requirements.
- **Create Squads:** Start your own squad, set the game, specify how many players you need, and set rank filters.
- **Join Instantly:** Browse available squads and join with a single tap.
- **Rank Matching:** Ensure youâ€™re teaming up with players at your skill level for a better gaming experience.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick match or building a regular team, SquadUP makes it easy to connect with other gamers who match your play style and skill level.
